                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Can video games be a platform for social change? Unlike books and movies, video games today still carry the stigma of being purely for entertainment while other forms of media have been adapted to carry heavy themes to influence people’s opinions. A growing category of games, titled “Serious Games”, has been created to refer to any game whose primary purpose is something other than entertainment, but for a multitude of reasons, games of this genre have failed to gain traction outside of niche markets, limiting their influence on the larger gaming market. It can be argued, however, that Serious Games may have taken the wrong approach by sacrificing gameplay. A recent trend for video games focused purely on entertainment to deliver compelling storylines coupled with engaging gameplay has given shape to a new, albeit indirect, medium for hosting social commentary.</p>
                <p>One example of a mainstream game that does this gameplay-commentary aspect very well are Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, a surprising choice given the overall popularity of the series. The rest of this essay will first aim to highlight the magnitude of the themes covered within these two games and then identify the particular elements of these games that made the messages conveyed so effective. These two games will then serve as the focal point through which the effectiveness of entertainment-focused games as a platform for social commentary will be explored.</p>

                <h3>Exposition</h3>
                <p>This section provides some exposition on the Fire Emblem series and Tellius, the setting of Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, needed to understand the major themes highlighted in the next section.</p>
                <h5>Fire Emblem</h5>
                <p>Fire Emblem is a Nintendo owned franchise of turn-based JRPG strategy games. Players control an army of units and fight through various maps by defeating enemies from the opposing army. Similar to other JRPGs, units will level up as they defeat more enemies and have stats describing the unit’s effectiveness in battle. A defining feature of the series is permanent character death; if any of the player’s units are killed, those units remain dead for the rest of the playthrough. The game gives incentive for players to avoid carelessly killing off their units by giving each unit their own character and personality. Individual levels are framed in terms of a larger story, usually focused around the main character fighting a war to save their country from evil invaders. The main character and story typically change with each new installment in the series, though there are exceptions. The series is well known both for its compelling strategy gameplay and its story, which keeps players motivated as they progress through the levels.</p>
                <p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the ninth game released in the series and follows Ike, the leader of a righteous band of mercenaries fighting to stop the advances of an evil king. Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn is Path of Radiance’s sequel, set 3 years after the end of the previous game. It follows Micaiah, the leader of a resistance group hoping to overthrow her country’s oppressive occupiers before returning to Ike’s point of view. </p>
                <h5>Tellius</h5>
                <p>Tellius is the name of the continent that both games take place on. It is home to two main categories of sentient inhabitants: normal humans, referred to as Beorc, and shapeshifters who can transform between human-like and fully animal forms, referred to as Laguz. There are several categories of Laguz based on whether their animal form is of a beast, bird, or dragon. There is a long history of tension between these two races, which serves as a primary motivator for the conflicts in both games.</p>
