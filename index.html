                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>Can video games be a platform for social change? Unlike books and movies, video games today still carry the stigma of being purely for entertainment while other forms of media have been adapted to carry heavy themes to influence people’s opinions. A growing category of games, titled “Serious Games”, has been created to refer to any game whose primary purpose is something other than entertainment, but for a multitude of reasons, games of this genre have failed to gain traction outside of niche markets, limiting their influence on the larger gaming market. It can be argued, however, that Serious Games may have taken the wrong approach by sacrificing gameplay. A recent trend for video games focused purely on entertainment to deliver compelling storylines coupled with engaging gameplay has given shape to a new, albeit indirect, medium for hosting social commentary.</p>
                <p>One example of a mainstream game that does this gameplay-commentary aspect very well are Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, a surprising choice given the overall popularity of the series. The rest of this essay will first aim to highlight the magnitude of the themes covered within these two games and then identify the particular elements of these games that made the messages conveyed so effective. These two games will then serve as the focal point through which the effectiveness of entertainment-focused games as a platform for social commentary will be explored.</p>
